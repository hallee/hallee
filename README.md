ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Hal, a sofware engineer living in Brooklyn and building apps for iOS.

Currently I work at [Quartz](https://qz.com), where I lead development of our relaunched, [member-focused news app](https://hal.codes/portfolio/quartz-relaunch/). Previously I worked on Quartzâ€™s [conversational news app](https://qz.com/613700/its-here-quartzs-first-news-app-for-iphone/).
